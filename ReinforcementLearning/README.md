# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a powerful branch of Machine Learning. It is used to solve interacting problems where the data observed up to time t is considered to decide which action to take at time t + 1. It is also used for Artificial Intelligence when training machines to perform tasks such as walking. Desired outcomes provide the AI with reward, undesired with punishment. Machines learn through trial and error.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Reinforcement Learning models:

Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)

Thompson Sampling
