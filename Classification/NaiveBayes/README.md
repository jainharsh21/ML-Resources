# Naive Bayes Classifier
It is a probabalistic type of classifier.
## Bayes Theorem

## Solving an example
1) Calculate P(A|X) 
2) Calculate P(B|X)
3) Check which one is greater and assign the point accordingly


### Step 1(Prior Probability)

### Step 2(Marginal Likelihood)
Draw a circle with a radius of your choice around the new point to be added...all points in the circle would be considered to have similar features.
While comparing both the probabilities we can get rid of marginal likelihood as it is same in both the cases.
